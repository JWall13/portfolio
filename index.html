                            <p>Welcome!  Clearly, my name is Jeremiah, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer
                            (in training).  I am originally from South Texas, outside of Corpus Christi.
                            I've lived in LA, and San Francisco, but didn't get the coding bug until my
                            mid-thirties after I had already been an actor, yoga teacher, and dental
                            hygienist.  As happened with many people over the multiple apocalypses 
                            spanning 2020 to 2021, I really started to re-evaluate my life decisions 
                            and what I wanted to do with my life.  And here I am!  Studying web 
                            development and making a significant career change.
