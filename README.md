# My Work Portfolio

##Description:  I'm just starting out, only in week 3 of bootcamp, so this is a pretty basic, bare-bones portfolio at the moment, not to mention I am making fun of myself.  However, I do plan on amping it up, making it better and prettier, and EVENTUALLY submitting it to potential employers- so please know that this is a work in progress.

It should be self-explanatory, but you will first encounter my name, picture, and navigation to other parts of the site (About me, My Work, and Contact).  The My Work section will be of most use to you as you will be able to be sent to my live sites that I've worked on and get a glimpse.  Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.

##Authors and Acknowledgement:  I am sorta the author here, but these sites were really guided and set up by the University of Texas: Bootcamp Division. Kinda like Legos are made and designs are included to make a log cabin by the company itself, I just bought it and put it together.

##License: Not messing with the legal stuff. Probably safe to say this is all owned by The University of Texas.
